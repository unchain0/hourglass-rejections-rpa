# Repository guide

Go 1.26 automation that reads Hourglass assignment rejections, persists user and execution state, and serves scheduled plus on-demand Telegram notifications. Four binaries share WebAuthn/Chrome token management, GORM persistence, i18n, and OpenTelemetry integration.

There is no `internal/` tree. Imports use `hourglass-rejections-rpa/src/...`; older README examples may still show pre-migration paths.

## Where to look

| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Daemon startup and run modes | `cmd/rpa/main.go` | `-once` currently delegates to an injected stub that returns “not implemented” |
| Dependency wiring | `cmd/rpa/bootstrap.go` | Selects Postgres from `DATABASE_URL`, otherwise preferences defaults |
| Authentication utilities | `cmd/{setup-auth,save-tokens,token-refresh}/main.go` | Interactive setup/extraction versus unattended renewal |
| Shared domain contracts | `src/domain_models/` | `AllSections` is the canonical section list |
| Hourglass HTTP and analysis | `src/services/hourglass/` | Cookies/XSRF, WebAuthn lifecycle, API-to-domain mapping |
| Scheduled execution | `src/services/scheduler/` | Business-hour policy, concurrent section analysis, cache/persistence |
| Telegram bot lifecycle | `src/services/bot/` | Preferences, manual checks, notifier startup |
| Telegram/email delivery | `src/services/notification/` | Callback ordering, whitelist, rate limit, i18n |
| Preference persistence | `src/integrations/database/preferences/` | GORM models, migrations, SQLite/Postgres selection |
| Browser/WebAuthn renewal | `src/integrations/auth/webauthn/` | Security-sensitive key and cookie handling |

## Code map

Go LSP and codegraph centrality were unavailable. `Refs` comes from ast-grep queries and import tracing, not semantic LSP references.

| Symbol | Type | Location | Refs | Role |
|--------|------|----------|------|------|
| `run` / `runFullMode` | functions | `cmd/rpa/main.go` | entry | Load config, start token manager, bot, scheduler |
| `buildDependencies` | function | `cmd/rpa/bootstrap.go` | 1 | Construct client, analyzer, preference store |
| `Client` | struct | `src/services/hourglass/client.go` | 4 packages | Hourglass HTTP, cookies, token renewal |
| `APIAnalyzer.AnalyzeSection` | method | `src/services/hourglass/analyzer.go` | 3 calls | Map four section families to rejection results |
| `TokenManager` | struct | `src/integrations/auth/webauthn/token_manager.go` | 4 constructors | Load, renew, persist auth cookies |
| `BotRunner.Run` | method | `src/services/bot/runner.go` | 1 call | Start Telegram updates and manual checks |
| `Scheduler.Run` | method | `src/services/scheduler/scheduler.go` | 1 call | Drive periodic concurrent analyses |
| `TelegramNotifier` | struct | `src/services/notification/telegram.go` | bot factory | Send messages and handle preference callbacks |
| `PreferenceStore` | interface | `src/integrations/database/preferences/store.go` | 8 files | Persist user preferences, runs, rejections, audit |

## Rules and invariants

- Treat `src/domain_models.AllSections` as the source of truth; analyzer aliases are input compatibility, not new canonical values.
- Use structured `log/slog`; telemetry supplies the default logger when OTLP is enabled.
- Do not log `hglogin`, XSRF cookies, WebAuthn private keys, Telegram tokens, database passwords, or full auth files.
- Do not weaken owner-only storage: secret directories are `0700`; token, credential, and SQLite files are `0600`.
- Do not convert documented best-effort Telegram or telemetry operations into fatal failures without tracing the caller behavior.
- Do not commit runtime artifacts such as root binaries, `coverage.out`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `.omo/`, Chrome profiles, or captured login requests.
- Local pre-push coverage is 95%; GitHub CI enforces 70% and skips a broader Chrome-dependent test set.

## Commands

```bash
make build          # build all four binaries
make test-short     # fast race suite with command/Chrome exclusions
make test           # full race suite and coverage.out
make fmt-check      # formatting target; note that it invokes go fmt
make lint           # golangci-lint v2
make ci-local       # local CI order plus build
make run-once       # build and invoke rpa -once
```

## Known gaps

- `Dockerfile` builds only `rpa`; Compose’s optional `token-refresh` service invokes `/app/token-refresh`, which is absent from that image.
- Full mode constructs a scheduler but does not call `Scheduler.SetNotifier`; verify intended scheduled-delivery wiring before changing this path.
- Working tests use `httptest`, hand-written interface mocks, `t.TempDir`, `t.Setenv`, and injected filesystem/browser functions. WebAuthn coverage is mostly mocked, but named Chrome cases remain excluded by hooks/CI.
- Read the nearest child `AGENTS.md` before editing a documented boundary; child guidance overrides this root file for its package.

# SonarQube secrets scanning for files protocol

Before reading any file in this workspace, scan it for secrets with the deterministic scanner:

```bash
sonar analyze secrets <path/to/file>
```

If the command reports that the file contains a secret, **do not read the file**. Instead:

1. Inform the user that the file appears to contain a secret or credential and that reading it would expose the value in chat history, logs, and any downstream telemetry.
2. Advise them to rotate the leaked credential at its source of truth and remove it from the file.
3. Do not proceed with the original request until the secret has been removed.
